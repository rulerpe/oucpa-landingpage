Service provided 
BUSINESS Session:
Business Tax Reporting (Forms 1065, 1120‑S, 1120)
We prepare and file partnership, S‑corporation, and C‑corporation returns from clean, reconciled books, and we maintain fixed‑asset and depreciation schedules so schedules tie out year to year. Owners receive complete K‑1 packages with basis tracking as needed, reasonable‑compensation support for S‑corps, and multi‑state apportionment when applicable—ending with a brief year‑end close summary so next year starts organized.
Bookkeeping & Payroll
We keep your financials current and payroll compliant. Monthly or quarterly bookkeeping includes bank and credit‑card reconciliations, clear financial statements, and practical notes on what changed. Payroll setup and processing covers filings and year‑end forms (W‑2s/1099s), and we work smoothly with QuickBooks Online and the major payroll platforms.
Incorporation & LLC CreationWe help you choose the right entity and handle filings end to end. This includes name availability and registered agent setup, preparation and filing of Articles of Incorporation/Organization, EIN issuance, a customized operating agreement, initial/annual lists and the State Business License, an optional S-corporation election when appropriate, and city/county tax and license registrations.
IRS & State Solutions
We resolve notices and clean up past issues so you can move ahead. That includes researching notices, drafting responses, arranging payment plans, requesting penalty relief when reasonable cause exists, and preparing catch‑up or amended returns

PERSONAL Session:
Personal Tax Reporting (Form 1040)
We file accurate, optimized individual returns with proactive guidance throughout the year. From wages and itemized deductions to investments, equity compensation, crypto, rentals, and K‑1s, we organize your documents, identify eligible credits, plan estimates, and explain results in plain language so there are no April surprises.
Tax Projection & Planning
We look forward, not backward. Mid‑year and year‑end projections show where your taxes are trending and model simple what‑ifs, then turn into concrete steps—estimated‑tax vouchers, safe‑harbor planning, and entity or compensation tweaks. We also evaluate retirement plan options (SEP, SIMPLE, Solo 401(k)) and coordinate QBI strategies to reduce overall tax.
